# UA Project Frontend

This project is aimed at publishing personal stories of people personally affected by the invasion of Ukraine. In the summer of 2022, I was given to read some personal correspondence on Messenger and WhatsApp, where the two affected people were describing their first-hand experience of the shelling of Nikopol. Reading stuff like that felt different than some "distanced" articles in the media. These messages had a very personal touch and one could easily imagine him/herself at their place. About a week later I got the idea to collect personal correspondence from people affected by war, translate them, and publish them as a book. I think it can bring a whole new, personal perspective on the war in Ukraine.

## Please, be mindful of the fact that ...

... this is not the final version of the website, it is still in the process of developement. E.g. language mutations are yet not ready (English version is not complete, the Ukrainian is still yet to be done). Some parts of the code are a bit messy and are expected to be fixed and refactored in the near future
